# Idle Capitalist

*Idle Capitalist* is an idle clicker game inspired by *AdVenture Capitalist* in which the player invests funds into certain businesses to generate revenue. The project was created for educational purposes as part of Jamesâ€™ **#GameInAWeek** challenge and is released freely under an MIT license. This project may be quite useful for those looking for a starting point in creating an idle game in Unity for mobile. Bugs and feedback welcomed! [@defuncart](https://twitter.com/defuncart)

## Conclusion

Although the mathematics of idle games are quite complex, and game balancing wasn't even considered due to time constraints, from an implementation point of view, *Idle Capitalist*, for the short period of time it was developed it, is quite a well-functioning idle clicker. This prototype could easily be extended to form a full game.
