# Sultan's Gems

*Sultan’s Gems* is a simple Match 3 game in which the player tries to achieve a high score within a certain number of moves by matching similar pieces. The project was created for educational purposes as part of James’ **#GameInAWeek** challenge and is released freely under an MIT license. It may be of interest to those looking for a starting point in creating a Match 3 game in Unity for mobile. Bugs and feedback welcomed! [@defuncart](https://twitter.com/defuncart)
